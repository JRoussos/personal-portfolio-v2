# The second version of my personal portfolio site 
Check it out at: [johnroussos.info](https://johnroussos.info/) 

## UPDATE 
I'm now in the process of updating the site!

## The what

For the second version I wanted to build something simple and modern looking. And as I have lately fallen for 3d animations and custom shaders, I used Three.js for this project.

## The how 

### I used: 
[gsap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gsap) for interpolate values passed to the shader.<br> 
[react-three/fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction) for the shaders. <br>
[react-device-detect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-device-detect) for serving different versions of the page in mobile and browser. <br>
[firebase](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebase) for hosting the page.
[react-router-dom](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start) for routing between pages. <br>
[node-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass) for compiling css.
